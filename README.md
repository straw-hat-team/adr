# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

TL;DR: ADRs are lots of documentation on how Straw Hat Team works.

## Overview

ADR stands for Architecture decision record, a design document providing
high-level, concise documentation for software development. The goal is for
these documents to serve as the source of truth for software-related
documentation at Straw Hat Team and the way teams discuss and come to consensus
on software development guidance.
