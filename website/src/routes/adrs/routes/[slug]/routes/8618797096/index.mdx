# Usage of JSX Fragment

- **State:** Approved
- **Created:** 2020-11-15
- **Tags:** jsx

## Context

Today we have a way to specify fragments in our React, Preact codebase or
any other library that adopts such technology.

- Using `Fragment` from React import:

  ```tsx
  import { Fragment } from 'react';
  function MyApp() {
    return <Fragment></Fragment>;
  }
  ```

- Importing everything under a scope:

  ```tsx
  import * as React from 'react';
  function MyApp() {
    return <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>;
  }
  ```

- Using JSX fragment short syntax:

  ```tsx
  function MyApp() {
    return <></>;
  }
  ```

There are no rules about this introducing inconsistency in the codebase, or in
some cases, refactoring of the import style is demanded.

As mentioned before, since React introduced JSX to our toolkit, multiple
libraries have adopted JSX, for example, a really popular alternative to React:
[Preact](https://preactjs.com/).

TypeScript [introduced a way to specify the Fragment factory](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/38720)
to allow people to have more control over the compiled JSX code.

Using `React.Fragment` couples the JSX to React, although most of your code will
probably never move to another library like Preact, the usage of
`React.Fragment` introduces more fragmentation in the ecosystem with little
benefits from it.

React team [introduced a new JSX Transform](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html)
that doesn't require React to be imported in the file, allowing JSX to be more
agnostic of the library.

## Resolution

- You **MUST** use JSX fragment short syntax `<></>`.

## Links

- [react/jsx-fragments](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-fragments.md)
  ESLint rule about JSX short syntax. We suggest to enable the rule with the
  following config:

  ```json
  {
    "rules": {
      "react/jsx-fragments": ["error", "syntax"]
    }
  }
  ```
