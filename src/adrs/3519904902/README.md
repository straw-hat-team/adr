# Enforcing Named Bindings in Ecto Queries

## Context

In our current system, we use Ecto for building and executing database queries.
Ecto allows to use named bindings when composing queries.

We will enforce the use of named bindings across all queries in our codebase.

### Clarity and Readability

Named bindings make it clear what each part of the query is referencing,
reducing confusion and increasing the maintainability of
the code.

### Avoiding Errors

When queries are combined, positional bindings can lead to
applying operations to the wrong entities, causing subtle bugs. Named bindings
eliminate this risk by explicitly naming each binding.

### Consistency

Adopting a standard practice across the codebase simplifies onboarding and code
reviews.

## Consequences

- Refactoring Effort: Existing queries using positional bindings will need to be
refactored to use named bindings.
- Learning Curve: Developers need to get accustomed to consistently using named
bindings.

## Resolution

- You **MUST** use named bindings in all Ecto queries except in cases where it
  is not possible.
