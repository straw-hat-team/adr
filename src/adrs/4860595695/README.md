# Human-Readable IDs

## Context

Choosing the right type of IDs for APIs affects usability, security, and
developer experience. Working with just UUIDs, integers, or random characters
can be cumbersome and error-prone. These IDs are often hard to remember, debug,
and integrate with other systems because they lack context about the resource
type.

That difficulty is exacerbated for Business Analysts dealing with massive
amounts of data from different sources, needing to understand the data structure
and relationships between resources. Or for developers without much experience
working with the system or domain.

Polymorphic values are a common pattern where you need to fetch a resource by
its ID without knowing the resource's type. Some APIs use a hash map to store
the type and ID, but this approach lacks human readability, requiring the type
and ID to be printed together for usefulness.

In distributed systems, simplifying data understanding is critical. Whether
using ETL software, data warehouses, or freelancers who don't have time to learn
all the data combinations, it's important to keep data self-sufficient and
easily understandable.

### Positive Consequences

- Usability: Easier for humans to read, remember, and use.
- Debugging: Simplifies identifying and understanding issues.
- Integration: Eases integration with other systems by providing context.

### Negative Consequences

- Potential Length: Human-readable IDs might be longer.

## Out of Scope

- Define the format of human-readable IDs. Although strongly recommended to
  use `[resource type]_[ulid]`, the format is not the focus of this ADR.

## Resolution

- You **MUST** use a human-readable ID as a single value to identify a resource.
- You **MUST** include the resource type as a prefix in the ID.
