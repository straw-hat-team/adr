## Context

Getting documentation right is a key part of the development process, but that
is rarely the case. Most people lack of the discipline or the ability to write
good documentation.
More often than not, the documentation is written in a style that complex
different concerns.
Or the structure of the documentation website is customized so much that readers
must understand what is what.

implemented in projects such as: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) or
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).
