# NodeJS source code directory structure

* **State:** Approved
* **Created:** 2020-11-21
* **Tags:** nodejs,directory

## Context

There are no guidelines on where to put the source code for your NodeJS
projects.

* Do I suppose to use `src`, `lib`, `dist` or `build` directories, or maybe put
everything at the root of the project?

Not having a clear guideline adds cognitive load, as well as add friction
contributing to projects, and sometimes relying on a particular group of people
that know the unspoken/undocumented rule.

In other completely valid cases, like putting everything at the root of the
project, don't take into consideration caveats like having so many metadata such
as `.gitignore`, `.prettierrc`, `.eslintrc`, `.markdownlint.json`,
`tsconfig.json` files and many other files and directories.

Subjectively speaking, they add noise and hard to navigate or concentrate when
put all your files at the root of the project.

Furthermore,

* Where do I suppose to put my test files? What are the differences between X and
Y directories?

* How to structure the project when I have multiple testing frameworks, or
multiple documentation tools?

This ADR is an attempt to follow the steps of other ecosystems like Elixir,
Ruby or Rust came to a consensus about this topic.

### About compilations

We should tell what requires compilation in the project, which is extremely
useful in library projects since you should be aware of such detail to consume
the project. Or in cases that you would like to run the project in production.

Having a directory that reflects such information is crucial to mitigate mistakes
in application deployments, or misuse of libraries.

### About test frameworks

Sometimes you may have multiple test frameworks for your project, most likely
for `end-to-end`, `integration`, or `unit` tests, but not limited to those
concepts. Therefore, people have tried to come up with `./tests/integration`,
`./tests/unit`, `./tests/end-to-end`.

Although that may be a clean way to structure your tests, the problems arrive
when you try to articulate the differences between those categories without
getting into an in-depth conversation about X vs. Y and end up with unclear
boundaries, relying too much on the programmer's experiences to articulate the
most optimal definition or decision.

Additionally, if you try to migrate your project to another testing tool that
falls into one of those possible categories, you will mingle tests that are
run differently depending on the underline tool, and that may be really
important in some cases.

### About documentation

Documentation tools are amazingly diverse in the ecosystem; such tools require
different configurations and code structure, therefore mingle tools may cause
incompatible situations, or confusing documentation source code.

Also, it is unclear today what should I do if I have multiple documentation
websites (internal or public as an example), and how to manage them.

## Resolution

* You **must** follow the following directory structures:

  ```text
  .
  ├── package.json
  ├── bin
  ├── dist
  ├── docs
  │   ├── storybook
  │   └── website
  │   └── website-next
  │   └── [another website or tool]
  ├── examples
  ├── lib
  ├── src
  └── tests
      ├── cypress
      └── jest
      └── puppeteer
      └── [another testing tool]
  ```

* In the `./tests` directory, you **must** use the tool's name to reflect the
  tool used to run the tests.
* You **must** place `storybook` documentation under `./docs`.
* In the `./docs` directory, you **must** separate documentation based on the
  underline tool or context (for example, **internal** or **public**).
* `./src` **must** required compilation step, and you **must** compile the
  source code into `./dist` directory.
* `./dist` **must** required to compile `./src` directory to generate
  the source code, or any other compilation step in required cases.

### About files and directories

* **./package.json:** the NodeJS package configuration.
* **./bin:** contains executables files.
* **./dist:** contains compiled source code.
* **./docs:** contains the documentation of the project.
* **./examples:** contains examples of the project's usage, primarily used
  in library projects.
* **./lib:** source code that does not require compilation.
* **./src:** source code that requires some compilation.
* **./tests:** contains the tests files.
